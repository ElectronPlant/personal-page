The proposed monitoring method was able to outperform the equivalent naive monitoring methods of equivalent battery life by reducing the \\ac{mse} of the reconstructed signal by 42%. The monitoring method proposed in this publication manages two competing goals, maximizing the monitoring accuracy (through the relevance-aware behavior), and achieving the target battery lifetime (through the energy-aware behavior). Furthermore, it was shown to be able to comply with the battery lifetime target.</p> <p>          Relating Context and Self Awareness in the Internet of Things      </p> <p> [C.II] D. Arnaiz, M.

The proposed monitoring method was able to reduce the \\ac{mse} of the reconstructed signal by up to 19\\/\\% with regards to the same monitoring method which only considers the battery life for the adaptive behavior, and by up to 16% compared with the other method with only one control parameter.</p> <p>          On Anomaly-Aware Structural Health Monitoring at the Extreme Edge      </p> <p> [C.IV] D.

Both datasets have been collected with a sampling period of 10s over several weeks. The first dataset is composed of 302845 samples, and the second of 504862 samples. The first dataset is intended to be used for training to set the necessary parameters and the second dataset to validate the monitoring method. This dataset was collected to support {[C.III]} to simulate real sensor measurements. The relative pressure data has the lowest variability of all the data, the relative humidity data has intermediate variability, and the light intensity data has significantly larger variability. Thus these data test any monitoring algorithm with data showcasing different levels of variability.</p> <p>          UPC Benchmark Structure      </p> <p> [C.VI] D. Arnaiz, E. Alarc\u00f3n, F.

Wireless sensor nodes in an IoT network are resource constrained devices, particularly regarding their limited battery life. DEM enables wireless sensor nodes to optimize their resource optimization by dynamically adjusting to their changing operating conditions. For example, if a sensor node is monitoring for wildfires the monitoring requires are not the same after a rainy day when the risk of fire is low, than during the summer season when the fire risk is high. Despite the success in DEM over the past few decades, most of the existing methods rely on simple static behaviors or only monitor a few parameters to guide their adaptive behavior. The work presented in this thesis, research the use of Self-Awareness to enable the implementation of more complex adaptive behaviors directly at the sensor node level. In this context, a device is considered to be self-aware if it's able to monitor itself and its environment, use this information to learn and maintain models in an ongoing basis, and use this information to make intelligent decisions at runtime based on its high-level operational goals.</p> <p>Observe Decide Act (ODA) loop</p>"},{"location":"research/thesis/#msc-thesis","title":"M.Sc.
